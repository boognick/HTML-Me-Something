					<h2>Quebec - Ween</h2>
					<p>While most people would consider Ween to be somewhat of a novelty in music, this album will defy those expectations.  With a variety of genre bending tracks, strong depressive undertones, and Ween's trademark irreverance, this 2003 album is not to be skipped.</p>

					<h2>Why Love Now? - Pissed Jeans</h2>
					<p>With a name like Pissed Jeans, how could one pass up any chance to give them a listen?  Previous albums established them as crass yet relatable sludge punks.  Why Love Now? keeps the gritty and harsh tones that put them on the map while innovating with a more accessible and melody driven motif.  The juxtaposition of tough sounding music with themes of crushing the heteronormative idea of masculinity makes this a record that is unforgettable.</p>

					<h2>Freedom of Choice - DEVO</h2>
					<p>What can be said about DEVO that hasn't already been said?  The New Wave legends turned the music world upside down with their fearless and boundary breaking musical style.  If I were to recommend one DEVO album that everyone should listen to, it would most definitely be Freedom of Choice.  While previous records leaned hard into their outsider punk tendencies, this one has strong pop sensibilities.  Tracks like Gates of Steel, the titular Freedom of Choice, and of course, Whip It, are super catchy and make this album one that even those unfamiliar with DEVO can enjoy.</p>

					<h2>Street Worms - Viagra Boys</h2>
					<p>Viagra Boys hit the ground running with a strong and memorable debut album.  If you're bored of the current trends in alternative music, then Street Worms has you covered.  It's clear that the members of the band are talented musicians who don't take themselves too serioulsy.  With a chunky yet driving bass, hard drum rhythms, the rough vocal style, and even a saxophone, this album is not one to gloss over. Listen to it from front to back.</p>
